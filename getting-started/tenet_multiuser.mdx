## Overview

Tenet functions as an organization management system where multiple users can be associated with a single organization. When a new user registers, a new organization is automatically created for them, and they are assigned the role of staff within that organization.

## User Registration and Organization Creation

1. **New User Registration**:
   - When a new user registers, the system automatically creates an organization for them.
   - The registering user becomes a staff member of the newly created organization.

## Adding Users to an Existing Organization

To add additional users to an existing organization, follow these steps:

1. **Access User List Page**:
   - Navigate to the `User List` page within the `User` tab in the left-hand navigation menu.

2. **Create User**:
   - Click on the `Create User` button to initiate the process of adding a new user to the organization.

This setup allows for efficient management of users and organizations within the Tenet system, ensuring seamless collaboration among staff members.
