## Steps to Schedule a Meeting

AI Voice Agents will connect to your phone number and link to a calendar of your choice. Hereâ€™s how they work:

1. **Call Reception**:
   - When a call is received on the assigned phone number, the agent will answer the call.
2. **Booking Events**:
   - The agent will ask for details to book an event.
   - After collecting all necessary information, the agent will find free slots in your calendar.
   - The agent will then book the meeting for you.

This setup ensures that AI Voice Agents can efficiently manage inbound calls and schedule meetings using integrated calendar services.
